# Neos Fusion Language support

This extension adds language support for Fusion for [Neos CMS](https://www.neos.io/) projects.

## Features

* Basic syntax highlighting for Fusion
* [AFX](https://github.com/neos/fusion-afx) Syntax support
* Code-Snippets for Fusion-Objects

## Release Notes

### 2.1.0 
* Update dependencies
    - npm update within the boundaries of the package.json
    - resolves dependabot alerts
* Resolves a syntax highlighting issue with hashes in strings (see [#14](https://github.com/networkteam/vscode-neos-fusion/issues/14))

### 2.0.0

* Support for Tailwind CSS, and proper HTML support in AFX blocks
    - before, this was done via a custom HTML syntax definition.
    - now, we are re-using the default HTML syntax, as explained in [Embedded Languages](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide#embedded-languages)
    - Additionally, inside `extension.ts`, we automatically configure the [Tailwind CSS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) extension setting `tailwindCSS.includeLanguages` to include Fusion. This way, TailwindCSS IntelliSense works for AFX.
    - Finally, we use `injections` in `fusion.tmLanguage.fusion` to inject the {....} syntax into the HTML grammar.
